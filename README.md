# Findings
The NHS incurs significant, potentially avoidable, costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments. Therefore, reducing or eliminating missed appointments would be beneficial financially as well as socially. This analysis will investigate the capacity of the networks and staff involved and the actual utilisation of resources.


While the monthly capacity utilisation spiked to an all time high of 84.5% on Nov 2021, 
healthcare capacity have not reached it's limits.

Average appointment attended ranged between 20 – 30 million.
There were very low number of patients not attending appointments. (< 1.57 million per month)

There is a low number of appointments every Sunday and a high number of appointments every monday for general practice. In addition, the number of appointments generally decreases from Monday to Sunday. This trend for general practice is consistent across all seasons.

This can plausibly be because most patients’ well-being was affected during working (Monday to Friday) and non-working days. (Saturday – Sunday)

For the month of August 2021,

About 50% of national category appointments related to General consultation routine.

Over 90% of context type appointments were related to care related encounters.

Over 90% of service settings appointments were related to general practice.

There were a significant number of patients making appointments on the same day, followed by appointments made within a week, 2 weeks and 1 day in advance.

Majority of patients preferred Face-to-Face and Telephone consultations. NHS can look into reallocating GP appointments to teleconsultations.

The NHS can look into reducing these numbers by investigating further into the the reasons why these appointments are unmapped. In doing so, will allow NHS to be more efficient in allocating resources.

Based on current trending hashtags on twitter, the top 3 hashtags were all related to
Health. (health, healthcare and medicine)


## Recommendations
Reallocate staff on weekends to weekdays

Promote teleconsultation as it reduces wait time, decreases contact health risk and have direct access to different service settings.
Tweeting can be a powerful tool to raise awareness about clinical appointments, engage with patients and develop leads. It also increases exposure towards the medical industry. The NHS can plausibly set up a verified business twitter account to raise awareness of the cost of missing medical appointments. In addition, should there be any vital information to alert the people, twitter represents one of the fastest social media platforms to reach the masses.
